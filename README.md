## [Note]

## [Description]

1. [install lombok error case](https://github.com/GabrielBB/vscode-lombok/issues/23)
2. Basically, the api token check proceeds.
3. Inspect the endpoint and associate it with the corresponding server's host.
   (If not applicable, the request is not made to each server.)
4. By using a circuit breaker, failure is prevented.
5. If you run jvm as a docker container, do docker build & run.
